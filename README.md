#  📚 Time Tracker

Hi,
I'm Yoann, I'm currently deepening my knowledge in web development. I'm specialized in React frontend development.
I had fun coding all these projects!
Feel free to ask me questions and don't hesitate to look at my other projects ;)
Have fun coding!

## ✍️ Description 

The objective of this challenge is to create a time tracking application where users can create multiple independent activities with their own timer. The timer mechanics should be implemented according to the following constraints:

- Timers should be displayed in the format HH:MM:SS and should update every second.
- It should be possible to run multiple timers simultaneously.
- Keep the IDs assigned to the input and the button used to create an activity.
- The button to delete a tracker should have the class "delete."
- The buttons to start and stop a timer should display the text "Start" and "Stop," respectively.
- The reducer responsible for saving the activities in the Redux store should be created in the file reducers/activities.js.
- The activities should be preserved when the page is refreshed using the redux-persist module.
